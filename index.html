<h3>Research on disruptions, innovations and risks to critical infrastructures</h3>



<p>The climate crisis is accelerating the major overhaul of the power grid. Both the way we produce and consume energy now require coordinated engineering, economic, cultural and political interventions. Sitated between supply and demand is a growing need for collaboration—and this is where digital innovations are beginning to play a crucial role.</p>

<p>Digitalisation of energy systems is often positioned as a key enabler of decarbonisation, with use cases like supporting the electrification of transport and heating, through balancing the intermittency of renewables through smarter distribution and storage, to enabling tariffs that encourage flexible consumption.</p>

<p>However, upgrading the grid isn’t as simple as adding new technologies on top of existing infrastructure. Much of today’s energy system was built decades ago, using legacy computers and networks designed for stability and reliability, not for real-time data exchange, cybersecurity, or interoperability. Many of these systems were never meant to be connected to the internet.</p>

<p>Now, innovations relying on connectivity like IoT devices, cloud computing, AI-driven maintenance, and real-time analytics are being introduced into an ecosystem not originally designed to support them. This creates tension between the need for modernisation and the grid’s foundational goal: ensuring the safe and reliable delivery of electricity.</p>​

<p>The question is not just whether we can modernise the grid, but how we do so in ways that account for the complex entanglements between technology, governance, and everyday life. What kinds of policies, public debates and expert collaborations do we need to ensure that digitalisation supports, rather than disrupts, the secure, equitable, and sustainable delivery of energy? These are all sociotechnical challeges—and they demand careful, engaged and interdisciplinary responses.</p>
