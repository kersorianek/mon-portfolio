Hi, I’m Danni Long 👋

A few things about me:

- I ask a lot of questions — and sometimes, I even find good answers  
- I'm deeply curious about human behavior and how products are designed around it  
- I’m teaching myself digital drawing (slow progress, but cute sketches!)  
- I speak some German — C1-ish, still learning, still suffering 😉

I’m a data analyst with 4+ years of experience turning business chaos into clarity.  
With a background in consulting, I’ve worked across finance, logistics, and product teams to trace operational issues, uncover insights, and build dashboards people actually want to use.

What I care about most:  
**Helping teams make better decisions by making data feel trustworthy, understandable, and just a little bit delightful.**

Whether it’s figuring out why users drop off, debugging a broken order-to-cash flow, or simplifying a chart until the “aha” hits — I love when data makes something *click*.

### When I’m not wrangling data...
You’ll probably find me bouldering, boxing, or reading about psychology and behavior.  
Also: occasionally journaling about life, learning, and why we’re all weird in the best way.
