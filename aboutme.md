subtitle: An Economist's Journey to a Senior Data Scientist

Studying economics lead me to the paradox of choice: you feel qualified to pick up an innumerable number of career paths, yet you are not a perfect fit to one. Data science and analytics is something I felt I had an inner calling. 

## 1. Image Classification of Bottle Coolers

This project involved bringing massive value to the business through identifying faulty and non-performing bottle coolers automatically through classifying bottle cooler pictures. This harnessed the power of convolution neural network and Inception V3 deep neural network architecture. The insights about cooler productivity was generated through classifying the cooler pictures into 4 categories: good, bad, worse and non-fuctional. Involved in model training, model tuning and data pipeline building.

This affected all the other sections in the company as an accurate estimation of revanue was not possible. Used machine learning to forecast the quality of beef using DNA data.
