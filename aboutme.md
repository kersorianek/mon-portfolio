subtitle: Get to know me!

My name is Breena Simi Kumar, and I'm a rising junior at Michigan State University studying Data Science and Business. My dream job is in tech consulting, hopefully in a big city. I love to travel and experience different cultures. My favourite country I've been to so far is Fiji (I might be a bit biased since my family is from there)!

I want this website to serve as a platform where I can continue to edit and upload my projects and progress in data science. I think it can be a useful resource when maintaining the organization of my future projects.
