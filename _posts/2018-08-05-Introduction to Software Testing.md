Every one of us had a bad experience with the software. If you've used Facebook, WhatsApp, or Instagram, you've already encountered some difficulties. Even the best software on the planet has flaws. Software that does not function properly can cause various issues, including financial, time, and business reputation loss, as well as injury or death. That is why software testing is required.

# What is Software Testing?

**Software Testing:** is a set of activities that occurs throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC). The duration is usually determined by the project's development model.

In other words, software testing is the process of running a program or application in order to detect software bugs.

# What Software Testing is not?

- It does not find every single defect.
- It is not a case of randomly pressing buttons in the hope that something will break.
- It is not wishing for something to break.
- It's not something you do after all of your programming is finished.
- It's not something you put off until the users start complaining.

# What Software Tests will you perform?

- Whether or not the software meets the customer's requirements?
- Does the software respond correctly to all types of inputs, and can it respond logically?
- Does the software produce the desired results for all stakeholders?
- Is the software user-friendly enough for end users?
- Can the software be deployed and run in the environments intended?

# Why is software testing necessary?

In SDLC, errors can occur during requirement elicitation, software design, code development, and so on. Critical errors can result in a variety of losses and damages. Testing is required for a variety of reasons, including:

- It is necessary to identify and highlight any defects or errors that may have crept into software during development. It is essential to meet the customer's expectations.
- If the customer is satisfied with the product's quality, he will gain confidence in the product, and satisfied customers are good for business, isn't it?
- Testing is also required to ensure that the software works properly; that it is fast, light, and does not crash. Well-tested software provides a significant competitive advantage.
- No developer is perfect. If you've ever written incorrect code, you should understand why you need to test your software.
- The Golden Rule of Testing states that defects should be discovered as soon as possible. When problems with the software are discovered early on, it is often trivial for a developer to add a fix.


# Concept of Validation & Verification

Software testing also entails confirming that the correct software was produced. **Verification** ensures that you are building the correct program; **Validation** ensures that you are building the correct software.
In other words, verification ensures that the system does not crash, that it fits the requirements, that errors are handled graciously, and so on. Validation ensures that the criteria fit the customer's actual needs: Does the software fulfill the user's expectations? Are there any gaps in the specifications such that the user will be dissatisfied with the product even if the program meets all of the needs?

The software testing process includes both verification and validation. Although most testers spend a significant amount of time on verification, a software tester does not simply confirm that the product fits the requirements. Testers can be regarded of as defenders of the user experience, even going up against other corporate stakeholders in order to create software that fulfills the demands of users rather than just the bottom line.

Remember that the purpose of software testing is to **estimate** and, if possible, **reduce** the risk to stakeholders. Understanding the potential risks can help to reduce risk. After all, untested software that has never been run could be flawless or completely inoperable. Testing assists in determining where the software _actually_ lies between those two extremes. It can assist us in determining whether there are minor issues with the software or issues that should prevent the product from shipping because major functionality does not work. Software testers assist other stakeholders in making appropriate decisions by assisting in determining the level of risk. \*
