Today, the tide of protectionist feeling is sweeping the country. Someone could be talking with his buddies, checking the weather forecast before leaving the house, or sitting at home ordering dinner. Someone is once again perusing through Facebook unnecessarily. People use mobile gadgets from the moment they wake up until they go to bed.

The rise of mobile applications and mobile devices in recent years has necessitated the necessity for mobile testing. Currently, not all of these organizations are developing mobile applications, but 84% plan to do so in the near future.
According to one survey, 50 percent of mobile applications are used only once after downloading, and if a user experiences a glitch only once, more than half of users erase the application from their mobile device.

This demonstrates how critical mobile testing is to the success of any firm. Because of the differences in operating systems (iOS and Android), screen size, and resolution, mobile application development and testing are much more difficult.

We use our phones in various places. We have high-speed Wi-Fi at home. when walking, on 4G, 3G, and occasionally when there is no internet connection To deal with issues, we should always consider the most effective technique to test the application. Let's look at some of the greatest mobile application testing practices:

Testing on real devices is one of the recommended practices for mobile application testing. The usage of emulators and simulators is beneficial in the early phases of development. The application must be tested on a real device so that the tester may be confident that the test findings are accurate. Testing on real devices also provides the tester with a better understanding of overall usability.

Fix your device and operating system before testing. There are thousands of Android devices and hundreds of iOS devices in the market. When you test your company's application, always choose the device that most of your customers use. For example, iPhone 8, iOS 10.1.
If you do not know which device the customer is using, select the most used devices in the market. You can easily find this data through Google search. In addition to Google Analytics, there are many such analytics tools available online.

Always think about the edge cases, imagine you are a phone user and you use the app while walking you will probably find slow internet, not Wi-Fi when you are in the office. Check your application for a slow internet connection.

Check battery consumption rate, Power-Hungry applications have a higher rate of removal from devices. Check how much battery your application consumes. If you notice "Hmm, this device is getting hot" then report this too. This could be a good start for the investigation. Also, from the settings of the mobile phone, you can see how much battery it is consuming.

Always check that your application supports horizontal mode, you can catch a lot of visual problems just by turning the phone 90 degrees!

What are the types of mobile applications?

Native applications are installed from the App Store, such as Google Play for Android and Apple's App Store. Applications that can be installed and run on your devices are known as native applications. For example, Facebook and WhatsApp.

Web applications, web applications run from mobile web browsers to Google Chrome Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Safari, etc. using mobile networks or Wi-Fi. For example, www.m.nba.com and www.m.amazon.com.

Hybrid application, a hybrid application is a combination of native application and web application. They can run on devices or offline and are prepared using web technologies like HTML 5 and CSS. eBay is an excellent example of a hybrid application.

Nowadays mobile testing is an on-demand profession and it is always useful to know how to do mobile testing. Also, as a mobile software tester, you have a lot of opportunities for freelancing. Many organizations hire remote testers to test their applications.
