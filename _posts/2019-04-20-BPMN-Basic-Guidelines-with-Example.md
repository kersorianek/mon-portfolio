As a business analyst, you're always looking for ways to improve your organization's processes and workflows. One powerful tool that can help you achieve this is BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation). In this beginner's guide to BPMN, we'll cover everything you need to know to implement it in your next project.

Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) 2.0 Model

# What is BPMN?

BPMN is a graphical notation used to model business processes and workflows. It's used to represent complex processes in a way that's easy to understand and communicate.

BPMN stands for Business Process Modeling Notation. It is a graphical notation style; In other word, a visual language. BPMN is a flow chart based modeling language.
It describes processes as flow of activities, or actions, arranged in swimming lanes, representing activity performers

BPMN was created in 2004 by the Business Process Management Initiative (BPMI). BPMI collaborated with the Object Management Group (OMG) in 2005.

# Why is BPMN important?

BPMN is important because it helps you:

## Visualize complex processes: 
With BPMN, you can create diagrams that represent your organization's processes and workflows in a way that's easy to understand.

## Identify areas for improvement: 
By analyzing your BPMN diagrams, you can identify areas where processes can be streamlined or improved.

## Communicate more effectively: 
BPMN provides a common language for communicating about business processes and workflows, which can help reduce confusion and improve collaboration.

Everyone from business analysts to developers to company managers may "speak the same language" and confidently adjust to changing conditions.

# Benefits of Using BPMN:
- All stakeholders can understand how a process works
- IT and business analysts can work together on a consistent, accurate process design 
- Everyone can understand how a technical process lives within the bigger business picture

BPMN Allow you to GAP Analysis during requirement analysis and model 
1.  Current state: “as-is”
2.  Future state: “to-be”


# How does BPMN work?

## BPMN diagrams are made up of a few basic elements:

## Activities: 
These represent tasks that need to be performed in a process.

## Gateways: 
These represent decision points in a process.

## Events: 
These represent something that happens in a process, such as the start or end of a process.

## Flows:
These represent the sequence in which activities, gateways, and events occur in a process.

# Basic Components of BMPN: 
	1. Swimming Lane: Independent Process (Divider between processes)
	2. Lane:  Functionality or Activity within a Swimming Lane
	3. Event:  Mark start and end of a process. 
	4. Gateway: Control process flow, Can test a decision.
	5. Activity: Process or Sub process. Naming convention should use verb and noun
	6. Sequence Flow: A solid arrow that connects Event, Activity, and Gateway

## Activity: 
A BPMN Activity is simply "Work" that a company or organization performs in a business process. An Activity is can be atomic (Tasks) or decomposable (Sub-Processes). There are basically three BPMN activity types:

	1. BPMN Task
	2. BPMN Sub-Process
	3. BPMN Call Activity


A BPMN task is an atomic activity within a process flow. You create a task when the activity cannot be broken down to a finer level of detail. Generally, a person or applications will perform the task when it is executed.

In BPMN 2.0, there are different types of tasks identified for use in representing more specific behavior that tasks might represent. Here is a list of BPMN 2.0 task type:
- Service Task
- Send Task
- Receive Task
- User Task
- Manual Task
- Business Rule Task
- Script Task



### Service Task
A Service Task is a Task that uses a Web service, an automated application, or other kinds of service in completing the task.


### Send Task
A Send Task is represents a task that sends a Message to another pool. The Task is completed once the Message has been sent.

### Receive Task
A Receive Task indicates that the process has to wait for a message to arrive in order to continue. The Task is completed once the message has received.

### User Task
A User Task represents that a human performer performs the Task with the use of a software application.

### Manual Task
A Manual Task is a Task that is performed without the aid of any business process execution engine or any application.

### Business Rule Task
Business Rule Task is newly added in BPMN 2.0. It provides a mechanism for a process to provide input to a Business Rules Engine and then obtain the output provided by the Business Rules Engine.

### Script Task
A Script Task is executed by a business process engine. The task defines a script that the engine can interpret. When the task begin, the engine will execute the script. The Task will be completed when the script is completed.


### BPMN Sub-Processes
In BPMN, a sub-process is a compound activity that represents a collection of other tasks and sub-processes. Generally, we create BPMN diagrams to communicate processes with others. To facilitate effective communications, we really do not want to make a business process diagram too complex. By using sub-processes, you can split a complex process into multiple levels, which allows you to focus on a particular area in a single process diagram.


### Loop
Multi-instance
A Sub-Process with Multi-Instance marker indicates that the sub-process can run with other identical sub-processes simultaneously.

### BPMN Call Activities
A BPMN Call Activity references an Activity defined in a process that is external to the current process definition. It allows you to create a reusable process definition that can be reused in multiple other process definitions.

 # How to implement BPMN in your next project

If you want to implement BPMN in your next project, here are some steps to follow:

## Identify the process you want to model:
Start by identifying a process or workflow that you want to model using BPMN. This could be a new process that you're designing or an existing process that you want to improve.

## Create a BPMN diagram: 
Once you've identified the process you want to model, create a BPMN diagram that represents it. Use the basic elements we discussed earlier (activities, gateways, events, and flows) to create a clear and easy-to-understand diagram.

## Analyze the diagram: 
Once you've created your diagram, analyze it to identify areas where the process can be improved or streamlined.

## Implement changes: 

Based on your analysis, implement changes to the process to make it more efficient or effective.

Communicate the changes: Inform and confirm this changes with project stakeholder
