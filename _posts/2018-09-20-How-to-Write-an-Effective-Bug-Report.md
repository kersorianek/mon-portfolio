Someone might ask you how to write a nice bug report that would please the developer. In reality, there is no such thing as a bug report that can make a developer happy, no matter how wonderfully written it is.
Writing an accurate bug report is critical since it increases your chances of correcting any flaws you discover. Writing successful bug reports is simple; all you need is a decent pattern and some practice. Remember that the major task of a successful software tester is to prepare a good bug report.

Let's face reality now! In most circumstances, you will utilize a bug tracking program that automates the process of writing a bug report by filling in information such as a reporter or issue number. If you do not utilize such a tool, you must enter this information manually.

# What exactly is a bug report?

A bug report is a technical document that contains all of the relevant details about the bug and how it may be recreated. It is a guidance for the developers and the team working on the bug fix.

Everyone can write a bug report, but are they all effective?

## Definition of Bug

**Bug** is a software error which is caused due to fault or failure in the system. Another term for software **defect**.

# How to Write a Effective Bug Report

### Description aka Summary:

Keep it concise but informative. Consider your bug report to be a good tweet: keep it brief, sweet, and to the point.

### Reproduction Steps:

How did you get this bug? Make a list of all the steps you've taken.

### Expected Outcome:

In your situation, what is the expected behavior? Results are frequently preset and tied to consumer requirements.

### Achieved / Actual Results:

In your scenario, was that the behavior (results)? Write down the bug's real behavior.

### Screenshot:

An image is worth a thousand words. Capture this annoying bug with the appropriate screenshot or screencast!

#### Additional, but very important information you should provide:

- [x] The user credentials with which you created the bug.
- [x] Problem field / URL.
- [x] Product version (if applicable).
- [x] The browser you used, especially if there were design issues.

### Severity

- Priority: is determined by the severity of the defect. The most critical flaws should be addressed first.
- Intensity: display software bug effects.
  There are five levels of bug severity:

- [x] Blocker: No more tests can be performed.
- [x] Critical: Application crashes, data loss.
- [x] Major: Big loss of function.
- [x] Minor: Minor loss of work.
- [x] Trivial: small, UI error.

# Do's for Bug Reporting

- [x] When you're finished, DO READ YOUR REPORT. Make sure it's clear, simple, and easy to understand.
- [x] DO be as explicit as possible, leaving no space for ambiguity.
- [x] DO try to reproduce the bug several times and eliminate any needless procedures.
- [x] Include a workaround or additional procedures that cause the bug to behave differently in your report.
- [x] DO check to see whether the bug has already been reported. If it has, please add your information to the bug in a comment.
- [x] DO reply to requests for extra information from developers.

{: .box-warning}

# Don'ts for Bug Reporting

- [x] DO NOT submit more than one bug report. When there are multiple defects in the report, tracking the progress and interdependence of individual bugs becomes difficult.
- [x] DO NOT be judgmental or accusatory. Bugs are unavoidable, yet they are not always simple to fix.
- [x] DO NOT GUESS what's causing the bug. Stick to the facts to avoid sending the developer on a wild goose hunt.
- [x] DO NOT POST ANYTHING OTHER THAN A BUG. Developers appreciate your feedback, but sending it to the incorrect channel will just clog their workflow and cause unnecessary delays.
