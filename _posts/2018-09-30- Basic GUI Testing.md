Previously, performance optimization only applied to the server. Because the majority of the websites were static and their processes were performed on the server.
Web applications, on the other hand, have become more dynamic since the introduction of Web 2.0 technologies. As a result, the performance of client-side code has become an important requirement.

# What is GUI Testing

Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing is a procedure that verifies the expected performance of visual elements such as text, graphics, and buttons, as well as their functional accuracy.
The testing team can validate numerous graphical icons and visual indications such as radio buttons, dropdown menus, calendars, checkboxes, text boxes, and more by testing the graphical user interface.

GUI tests, whether performed manually or with the use of automated tools, focus on assessing the functionality and components of the graphical user interface, ensuring that it meets the visual specifications needed by users. This is accomplished by utilizing numerous test scenarios and test scripts.


# GUI Testing Guidelines:

When performing GUI testing, the examiners should keep a few key guidelines in mind to help them assess the accuracy of various visual indications. Here are some essential GUI testing guidelines:

It is critical for the team to review the GUI components such as font, size, length, width, and many others.

- Check that the error messages are properly presented.
- Check the font size and readability.
- Examine the text alignment.
- Image clarity and quality.
- Examine the position of GUI elements for various screen resolutions.
- Check the Terms of Service, Navigation, Data Integrity, and so on.
- Various methods for testing GUI:

There are three major methodologies in GUI testing that software testers all over the world utilize to validate the precision and quality of graphical user interface elements. Here are three approaches:


# Manual Based Testing:

All current graphical elements in a business document are manually checked by testers. A test, for example, can be multiplied manually (33X5).

# Replay and Record:

This is an automated GUI testing tool; during the test, all work is recorded. The recorded actions or tasks are carried out in the expected manner. This can be repeated numerous times, for example, with different data sets.

# Model-based experiments:

These types of experiments provide as visual descriptions (just like science models). This type of test predicts system behavior, and this technique generates test cases quickly. Charts and decision table models are used in some techniques.


# A Complete Checklist to Check Web Application:

- [x] Test that all mandatory fields are validated.
- [x] Verify that the asterisk sign appears for all mandatory fields.
- [x] Make sure that all of the text is appropriately positioned.
- [x] The system should not display the error notice for optional fields during testing.
- [x] Verify that leap years are accurately validated and do not create errors/miscalculations.
- [x] The numeric fields should not accept alphabets, and the appropriate error message should appear.
- [x] Check for negative integers if numeric fields are allowed.
- [x] For calculations, test division by zero should be handled properly.
- [x] Verify that the maximum length of each field is not truncated.
- [x] If the data exceeds the maximum size of the field, a pop-up warning ("This field is limited to 500 characters") should appear.
- [x] Verify that a confirmation message appears for update and remove activities.
- [x] The quantity values should be displayed in currency format when tested.
- [x] Experiment with the timeout functionality.
- [x] Experiment with the Sorting feature.
- [x] Check the functionality of the accessible buttons.
- [x] Only when necessary should a scroll bar emerge.
- [x] The Privacy Policy and FAQ should be well described and accessible to users.
- [x] All fields (textboxes, dropdown menus, radio buttons, and so on) and buttons should be available via keyboard shortcuts, and the user should be able to do all activities using the keyboard.
- [x] If any of the functionality fails, the user is sent to a custom error page.
- [x] Check that all of the uploaded documents can be opened successfully.
