Someone might ask you how to write a nice bug report that would please the developer. In reality, there is no such thing as a bug report that can make a developer happy, no matter how wonderfully written it is.
Writing an accurate bug report is critical since it increases your chances of correcting any flaws you discover. Writing successful bug reports is simple; all you need is a decent pattern and some practice. Remember that the major task of a successful software tester is to prepare a good bug report.

Let's face reality now! In most circumstances, you will utilize a bug tracking program that automates the process of writing a bug report by filling in information such as a reporter or issue number. If you do not utilize such a tool, you must enter this information manually.

# Description aka Summary:

Keep it short but informative. Think of your bug report as a good tweet: want your tweets to be short, sweet, and appropriate.

# Reproduction Steps:

How did you produce this bug? Write down all the steps you have followed.

# Expected Outcome:

What is the expected behavior in your case? Expected results are usually related to customer requirements and predetermined.

# Achieved / Actual Results:

In your case that was actually the behavior (results)? Write the actual behavior of the bug.

# Screenshot:

An image is worth a thousand words. Take the right screenshot or screencast and capture this annoying bug!

# Additional, but very important information you should provide:

[x] The user credentials with which you created the bug.
[x] Problem field / URL.
[x] Product version (if applicable).
[x] The browser you used, especially in case of design problems.

# Severity

Priority - It depends on the severity of the bug. The most serious bugs should be fixed first.
Intensity - Show bug effects in software. There are 5 types of bug severity:

 [x] Blocker: No more tests can be performed.
 [x] Critical: Application crashes, data loss.
 [x] Major: Big loss of function.
 [x] Minor: Minor loss of work.
 [x] Trivial: small, UI error.
