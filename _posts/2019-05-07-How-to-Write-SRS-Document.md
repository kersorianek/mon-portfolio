Software specification documents are sometimes regarded as things that only developers understand. An SRS, on the other hand, may go above and beyond to serve as a resource for marketing professionals, stakeholders, design teams, and even users.

# What is Software Requirement Specifications:

A software requirement specification (SRS) is a document that describes all aspects of a system's software. This covers things like functionality, performance, scalability, and so forth. SRS encompasses anything that has an impact on a system's software operations.

In other words, An SRS  is a document that outlines what the program will accomplish and how it will be expected to perform. It also specifies the functionality required for the product to meet the demands of all stakeholders (business and consumers).


# Why writing SRS is Important?

- A Clear, unambiguous, and executable SRS assist development teams in producing a quality product. 
- A well-written software requirement specification is essential to the success of your system.
- Product owners and stakeholders can use SRS papers to convey their particular product expectations.
- The software requirements documentation informs the team on which system components must be prioritized.
- In software engineering, requirements documentation improves clear communication between customer and client in a variety of ways.

# Who writes SRS documents?

Well it's pretty obvious. The business analyst is responsible for filling out the SRS and making sure that it's complete and accurate. And that's really what's utilized as you move into the next phases of the project to pass the requirements phase.


Writing an SRS document entails translating broad descriptions of features, tasks, and goals into a comprehensive plan for their technical execution.

SRS are often produced by product and project managers or business analysts that interact directly with clients or conduct user research (who also work on wireframes and understand how the product should operate) and gather needs for future projects.

Meanwhile, consider this paper. A good SRS is not only technical, but also encompasses business objectives, KPIs, user issues, user personas, and so forth.

## What is the standard format for SRS?
No there is no standard but it is pretty obvious that every organization use a SRS format based on their needs. But most of the information are almost similar.


# What are the major element of a SRS?
Each organization may have a different format for developing a Software Requirement Specification Document but you will found few similarities in all format: 

1. Introduction

           1.1 Purpose

           1.2 Intended Audience

           1.3 Intended Use

           1.4 Scope

           1.5 Definitions and Acronyms

2. Overall Description

           2.1 User Needs

           2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies

3. System Features and Requirements

            3.1 Functional Requirements

            3.2 External Interface Requirements

            3.3 System Features

            3.4 Nonfunctional Requirements

4. Data Requirements

            4.1 Data Dictionary 

            4.2 Reports
  

This is a basic outline and yours may contain more or fewer items.


## Checklist of Requirements Specification Audits:

### ✅ Organization and Completeness:
 - [ ] Is it right that all internal cross-references to other requirements are correct?
 - [ ] Is the amount of detail in all criteria constant and appropriate?
 - [ ] Do the criteria give a solid foundation for design?
 - [ ] Is each requirement's implementation priority included?
 - [ ] Is it possible to describe all external hardware, software, and communication interfaces?
 - [ ] Is it possible to define algorithms that are inherent to the functional requirements?
 - [ ] Is the specification complete in terms of all known customer or system requirements?
 - [ ] Is the anticipated behavior documented for all error conditions?
 
### ✅ Correctness:
- [ ] Are there any criteria that contradict with or duplicate others?
- [ ] Is each criterion expressed in clear, succinct, and straightforward language?
- [ ] Is each requirement testable, demonstrable, reviewable, or analyzable?
- [ ] Is each demand within the scope of the project?
- [ ] Is each requirement free of grammatical and substance errors?
- [ ] Is there any required information missing from a requirement? If so, is it labeled as TBD?
- [ ] Can all of the requirements be met within the limits that have been established?
- [ ] Are any of the supplied error messages distinct and meaningful?

### ✅ Quality Attributes:
- [ ] Are all performance goals well defined?
- [ ] Are all security and safety concerns adequately specified?
- [ ] Are additional relevant quality attribute targets well established and measured, as well as the acceptable tradeoffs?

### ✅ Tracebility:
- [ ] Is each need identified in a unique and proper manner?
- [ ] Is it possible to trace any software functional need back to a higher-level requirement (e.g., system requirement, use case)?

### ✅ Special Considerations:
- [ ] Are all requirements needs, rather than design or implementation solutions?
- [ ] Have all time-critical functions been identified and timing criteria established?
- [ ] Have problems concerning internationalization been appropriately addressed?
