# What is Software Requirement Specifications:

A software requirement specification (SRS) is a document that describes all aspects of a system's software. This covers things like functionality, performance, scalability, and so forth. SRS encompasses anything that has an impact on a system's software operations.

In other words, An SRS  is a document that outlines what the program will accomplish and how it will be expected to perform. It also specifies the functionality required for the product to meet the demands of all stakeholders (business and consumers).


# Why writing SRS is Important?

- A Clear, unambiguous, and executable SRS assist development teams in producing a quality product. 
- A well-written software requirement specification is essential to the success of your system.

# Who writes SRS documents?

Well it's pretty obvious. The business analyst is responsible for filling out the SRS and making sure that it's complete and accurate. And that's really what's utilized as you move into the next phases of the project to pass the requirements phase.


Writing an SRS document entails translating broad descriptions of features, tasks, and goals into a comprehensive plan for their technical execution.

SRS are often produced by product and project managers or business analysts that interact directly with clients or conduct user research (who also work on wireframes and understand how the product should operate) and gather needs for future projects.

Meanwhile, consider this paper. A good SRS is not only technical, but also encompasses business objectives, KPIs, user issues, user personas, and so forth.
