The first step in learning any programming language, in my opinion, is to ensure that you understand how to learn. The ability to learn how to learn is possibly the most important skill in computer programming.

# What is the significance of knowing how to learn?

The answer is straightforward: when languages evolve, libraries and tools are developed. Keeping up with these changes and being a great programmer will need knowing how to learn.

In this article, we'll go over numerous learning tactics that will help you get started on your path to becoming a rockstar Python programmer!

# Tip 1: Code Everyday

When learning a new language, consistency is important. We advocate committing to coding every day. It may be difficult to accept, but muscle memory is important in programming. Committing to coding every day will greatly aid in the development of muscle memory. Though it may appear daunting at first, consider beginning with 30 to 40 minutes per day and gradually increasing your time.

That is why we are embarking on the 30 minute a day Automation using Python challenge.

# Tip 2: Write It Out

As you grow as a new programmer, you may wonder whether you should be taking notes. You absolutely should! In fact, studies show that taking notes by hand is best for long-term memory. This will be especially useful for individuals aspiring to be full-time developers, as many interviews will require them to write code on a whiteboard.

When you begin working on tiny projects and programs, writing by hand might help you design your code before moving to the computer. You can save a lot of time if you lay down which functions and classes you'll require and how they'll interact.


# Tip 3: Take Breaks

When learning, it is critical to take a step back and digest the information. The Pomodoro Technique is popular and effective: you work for 25 minutes, take a small break, and then repeat the procedure. Taking breaks is essential for a productive study session, especially while learning a lot of new knowledge.
In programming, your code must strictly adhere to the rules of a language and logic, thus even a single missing quote mark will break everything. Fresh eyes make a significant difference.


# Tip 4: Teach

It is claimed that teaching is the finest method to learn something. This is especially true when studying Python. There are numerous ways to accomplish this, including whiteboarding with other Python enthusiasts, creating blog pieces that explain freshly taught concepts, and producing videos in which you explain something you learned. Each of these tactics will help to solidify your comprehension while also exposing any gaps.


# Tip 5: Pair Program

Pair programming is a process in which two developers collaborate on a single workstation to execute a task. The two developers alternate between the roles of "driver" and "navigator." The "driver" creates the code, while the "navigator" assists in issue solving and examines the code as it is created. Switch regularly to benefit from both sides.

Pair programming provides several advantages, including the ability to not only have someone examine your code, but also to understand how someone else would think about a problem. Being exposed to a variety of concepts and methods of thinking will help you solve problems when you return to coding on your own.

# Tip 6: Build Something, Anything

There are several little workouts for beginners that can help you gain confidence in Python as well as create the muscle memory that we discussed earlier. It's time to start constructing once you've mastered basic data structures (strings, lists, dictionaries, and sets), object-oriented programming, and class creation.

There are numerous lists of ideas for beginner Python projects available online. Here are a few suggestions to get you started:

- Number guessing game
- Simple calculator app
- Dice roll simulator and so on

# Tip 7: Contribute to Open Source

Software source code is publicly available in the open-source approach, and anyone can contribute. Many Python libraries are open-source projects that welcome contributions. Furthermore, many businesses release opensource projects. This implies you can use code authored and produced by the engineers employed by these firms.
Contributing to an open-source Python project is an excellent method to gain invaluable learning experiences. This will allow you to learn Python programming best practices as well as practice talking with other developers.

Now that you've mastered these learning tactics, you're ready to embark on your Python adventure!
