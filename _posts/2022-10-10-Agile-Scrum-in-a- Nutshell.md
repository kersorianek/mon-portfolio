# What is Agile?
Agile is the ability to create and respond to change. Agile values lean procedures and the development of minimum viable products (MVPs) that go through several iterations before being finished. Feedback is continually received and used, resulting in a far more dynamic process in which everyone is striving for a single goal.

# Agile: Scrum Methodology

Scrum is a methodology for handling complex adaptive issues in a productive and creative manner while providing high-value solutions. It is used to manage software projects as well as the development of new products and applications. It focuses on a flexible product development approach in which a cross-functional team collaborates to reach a common goal in 2-4 weeks (Sprint).

## The Scrum Framework
- Scrum is a lightweight agile project management framework mainly used for software development. It describes an iterative and incremental approach for project work.
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract.
- Responding to change over following a plan.
- Scrum Master and the Scrum Product Owner share his responsibilities. However, in the end the team decides what and how much they can do in a given project iteration (Sprint).
- Central aspect within the Scrum Framework is continuous improvement: inspect & adapt.
- The Scrum Framework tries to deal with the fact that the requirements are likely to change quickly or are not completely known at the start of the project.
- The low-level requirements are only defined at the time when they are going to be really implemented.
- The Scrum Product Owner works closely with the Scrum Team to identify and prioritize functionality. This functionality is written down in user stories (call Product Backlog Item in PSM) and stored in a Scrum Product Backlog.
- The Scrum Team is empowered to only select the user stories they are sure they can finish within the 2–4 weeks of Sprints.
- The Scrum Framework in its simple form is best used for smaller, one-team projects. But with the introduction of additional roles like the “Chief Scrum Product Owners” it is also usable in bigger multi-teams and/or distributed-team projects.

## Main components of Scrum Framework
- **Roles:** Scrum Master, Scrum Product Owner and the Scrum Team.
- A prioritized Backlog containing the end user requirements.
- Sprints.
- **Scrum Events:** Sprint Planning Meeting (WHAT-Meeting, HOW-Meeting), Daily Scrum Meeting, Sprint Review Meeting, Sprint Retrospective Meeting.

## Scrum Roles
-  The Scrum Team
-  Scrum Master
-  Scrum Product Owner

## The Scrum Team
-  A collection of individuals working together to deliver the requested and committed product increments.
-  The ideal size is 7 +/- 2 people.
-  Adheres the same norms and rules.
-  Accountable for delivery.
-  The Scrum Team is empowered and self-organizing to define:

what is will commit to deliver at the end of the Sprint?
How the expected results have to be broken down into tasks?
who will perform the task and in which order they are performed.
- It is working as autonomous as it is possible.
- the skills within the Scrum Team are balanced.
- team is small and has no sub-teams.
- the people within the Scrum Team work full time in the team.
- people are collocated, they all share the same title “Scrum Team Member”.
- shows respect to each other.
- no new Scrum Team will deliver with the highest possible performance right form the beginning. After setting up the team it has to go through certain phases as described by the Tuckman-Model: Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing.

## Responsibilities of the Scrum Team
-  To breakdown the requirements, create task, estimate and distribute them. Then, write its down to Sprint Backlog.
-  To perform the short Daily Sprint Meeting.
-  To ensure that at the end of the Sprint potentially shippable functionality is delivered.
-  To update the status and the remaining efforts for their tasks to allow creation of a Sprint Burndown Diagram.
### Scrum Master
-  A servant-master with the Scrum Team.
-  Make the Scrum team understand how Scrum operates, to protect the Scrum Team from external interruptions and to remove impediments that hinder the Scrum Team to reach its maximum productivity.
### Responsibilities of the Scrum Master
-  Guard the Scrum Team from external requests and disruptions.
-  Act as a change agent and adapt processes to maximize productivity of the team.
-  Coach the Scrum Team.
- remove impediments for the Scrum Team.
- ensure efficient communication between the Scrum Team and the Scrum Product Owner.
- facilitate the various Scrum Events:
1. Daily Scrum Meetings
2. Sprint Planning Meetings
3. Sprint Review Meetings
4. Sprint Retrospective Meeting

### Scrum Product Owner
-  Requirement engineering.
-  Writes down the most important use-cases.
-  Discusses the use-cases with the architects, customer representatives and other stakeholders.
-  Collecting the high level use-cases and requirements, then writes them into the Scrum Product Backlog.
-  Initiates and estimation and prioritization session with the architects and some senior developers.
-  All the items in the Scrum Product Backlog have an initial rough estimation and a prioritization.
-  Break-down the high level requirements into smaller-grained user stories.-
-  With this list, the Product Owners calls for the first Sprint Planning meeting.
-  Maximizing the value of the product by ensuring that the right work is done at the right time.

### Responsibilities of the Scrum Product Owner
-  Managing the Scrum Product Backlog.
-  Release Management.
-  Stakeholder Management.
-  Work closely with the Scrum Team.
-  Responsible for checking and accepting the Sprint results during the Sprint review session.

### Scrum Product Backlog
-  List of all things that needs to be done within the project.
-  Each entry in the Scrum Product Backlog must have some kind of customer value. Entries without any customer value are pure waste and should not be present anyway.
-  Should not contain the detailed requirement information.
-  Properties of each Scrum Product Backlog item:
- an entry in the Scrum Product Backlog always add value for the customer.
- the entries in the Scrum Product Backlog are prioritized and ordered accordingly.
- the level of detail depends on the position of the entry within the Scrum Product Backlog.
- all entries are estimated.
- the Scrum Product Backlog is a living document.
- there are no action-items or low-level tasks in the Scrum Product Backlog.
- includes entries for the exploration of customer needs or various technical options, a description of both functional and nonfunctional requirements, the work necessary to launch the product, and other items as well.
- added value, costs and risks are the most common factors for prioritization.
- about 10% of the Scrum Teams total time should be reserved for maintaining the Scrum Product Backlog.

## Scrum User Stories
-  The entries in the Scrum Product Backlog.
-  Tells a short story about someone using the product.
-  Focus on exactly what the user needs without going into the details on how to achieve it.
-  Be a descriptive sentence.
## Sprint Backlog
-  All entries have to be estimated on a person-hour base in order to track progress and remaining efforts.
-  The Sprint Backlog is a living artifact and is updated on a daily base.
-  At the end fo the day all remaining efforts are updated an this defines how much work is left until the Sprint Goal is reached.
## Sprint
-  Sprint are always short and normally about 2–4 weeks.
-  Sprint Planning Meeting includes WHAT-Meeting and HOW-Meeting.
- WHAT-Meeting the Scrum Team commits to the User Stories from the Scrum Product Backlog and it uses a HOW-Meeting to break the committed User Stories into smaller and concrete tasks. Then implementation begins.
	• Iterative process: Stakeholder requirements > Update Product Backlog -> Sprint Planning Session -> Daily Sprint Meeting -> Sprint Review Session -> Potentially deliverable Product -> Release -> Sprint Retrospective

## Sprint Planning Meeting

### WHAT-Meeting
- the Scrum Product Owner defines the Sprint Goal.
- based on this goal the relevant entries in the Scrum Product Backlog are chosen by the Scrum Product Owner.
- these entries are updated and broken into smaller stories so that they can be completed within on Sprint.
- the entries are estimated & prioritized.
- the team defines their capacity for the upcoming Sprint.
- define the Sprint Goal in a short description.
- estimate the team capacity from Sprint to Sprint due to the capacity might change e.g. vacations, public holidays, efforts for Scrum Meetings and time needed for other activities.
###  HOW-Meeting
- all WHAT-Meeting selected backlog items will be the input of the HOW-Meeting.
- identifying the concrete tasks needed for complete implementation of the Scrum Product Backlog entries. Base for this estimation should be person-hours.
- tasks normally include design, implementation, test and documentation activities.
- can be down in a separate session after the WHAT-Meeting.
### Rules & Norms: 

- Time and location of the Daily Scrum Meeting.
- The Definition Of Done (DoD) used to decide if work is finished or not.
- Code guidelines.
- Tools to use.

## Sprint in details
- Sprint 1- Day 0
Product Owner presents the Product Backlog items from the highest priority to the lowest. The team clarifies open questions and for each item the team discuss. After this discussion, the development team commits to complete the selected stories until the end of this Sprint. After the Sprint Planning, the Scrum Master calls the team to define the details of how the committed items are going to be implemented. The resulting tasks are written down on the cards at the prepared Sprint Task board. Now everyone of the Development Team selects a task to work on.
- Sprint 1- Day 1
In Daily Scrum Meeting, everyone in Development Team gives a short statement what has been achieved so far, update the estimation of remains hours on the cards of the Sprint Task board, tells what he/she is planning to do today and tells if there are any impediments that hinders him to continue his work. After the meeting, the Scrum Master updates the Sprint Burndown.
- Sprint 1- Day 28
The final day of the first Sprint. The Scrum Master has invited the Development Team for the Sprint Review Meeting. The Development Team has prepared a machine with the current software implementation. The Product Owner sits in front of the machine and checks if the implementation meets his expectations and if the features are documented as required. If it is needed, 3-parties will be invited to join the meeting and give any suggestion or comment.
- Sprint 2- Day 1
The Product Owner adds new items to the Product Backlog based on his recent customer meetings. Any user stories that’s not been completed on before Sprint will be re-factoring and add back to the this Sprint. The Development Team discusses and commits to stories with the guidance of the Scrum Master and the second Sprint begins.
Definition Of Done (DOD)

A comprehensive checklist of necessary activities that ensure that only truly done features are delivered, not only in terms of functionality but in terms of quality as well.

### Daily Scrum Meeting / Daily Stand-up Meeting:
-  A short everyday meeting during Sprint, not more than 15 minutes.
- Each team member should briefly provide the answers of the following three questions:
    - what has he/she accomplished since the last daily Scrum meeting?
    - what is he/she is going to accomplish until the next Scrum meeting?
    - what are the impediments that prevent he/she from accomplishing his/her tasks?
	• No issues or concerns raised during the meeting are allowed to be ignored due to the lack of time. Issues or concerns ought to be recorded by the Scrum Master and needs to be specifically handled after the meeting.
### Sprint Review Meeting
-  Take place in the form of a demo of the new features.
-  Backlog items that are not completed shall not be demonstrated.
-  Incomplete items shall be taken back into the Scrum Product Backlog, re-estimated and completed in on of the following Sprints.
-  Should be kept very informal. No PowerPoint slides should be used and time for preparation and performing the meeting should be limited.
-  Scrum Product Owner inspects the implemented backlog entries and accepts the solution or adds new stories to the Scrum Product Backlog to adapt the functionality.

### Sprint Retrospective Meeting
-  Time-boxed event.
-  An integral part of the “inspect and adapt” process.
-  Actionable suggestion to improve performance should be available at the end of the meeting.
-  All team members reflect on the past Sprint and check three things:
- - what went well during the Sprint, what didn’t.
- - what improvements could be made in the next Sprint.

### Distributed Scrum Teams
-  Can slide the teams in different manners as Component or Feature teams or Both.
-  Component Team — each team is only responsible for the implementation for dedicated components in the system. For example, User Interface, Business Logic and Infrastructure.
-  Feature Team — fully responsible for implementation on of user stories as contained in the Scrum Backlog.
