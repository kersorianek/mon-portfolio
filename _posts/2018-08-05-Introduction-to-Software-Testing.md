Every one of us had a bad experience with the software. It's likely that you've encountered some issues while using popular software like Facebook, WhatsApp, or Instagram. This is because even the best software can have flaws. However, software that doesn't function properly can lead to financial losses, waste of time, damage to business reputation, and even cause harm or injury. This is why software testing is crucial in identifying and addressing issues before they can cause any harm.

In this comprehensive guide, we will introduce you to the basics of software testing, including the different types of software tests, why testing is necessary, and the concept of validation and verification in software testing.

# What is Software Testing?

Software testing is a critical process for evaluating software applications to ensure that they meet the desired quality standards. It involves executing the software with the objective of identifying defects and verifying that the software complies with the specified requirements.

It's essential to note that software testing is not the same as debugging. Debugging is the process of identifying and correcting defects in the software, while testing is the process of identifying defects in the software and ensuring that the software meets the specified requirements. Both of these processes are essential to ensuring the quality of the software and preventing issues such as financial loss, time loss, and harm to business reputation, as well as injury or death in some cases. Therefore, software testing is a vital aspect of software development that should not be overlooked.

##  What Software Testing is not?

- It does not find every single defect.
- It is not a case of randomly pressing buttons in the hope that something will break.
- It is not wishing for something to break.
- It's not something you do after all of your programming is finished.
- It's not something you put off until the users start complaining.

# What Software Tests will you perform?

- Whether or not the software meets the customer's requirements?
- Does the software respond correctly to all types of inputs, and can it respond logically?
- Does the software produce the desired results for all stakeholders?
- Is the software user-friendly enough for end users?
- Can the software be deployed and run in the environments intended?



## Why is software testing necessary?

In SDLC, errors can occur during requirement elicitation, software design, code development, and so on. Critical errors can result in a variety of losses and damages. Software testing is essential for several reasons, including:

### Ensuring software quality: 
Software testing helps to ensure that the software meets the desired quality standards and works as expected. This can help to enhance customer satisfaction and prevent negative reviews.

### Identifying defects and bugs: 
The testing process helps to identify defects and bugs in the software and fix them before the software is released to end-users or customers. This can help to prevent customer frustration and reduce the risk of reputational damage.

### Reducing the risk of software failure: 
Failure of software could result in loss of data, revenue, and customer trust. By testing software thoroughly, businesses can reduce the risk of software failure and minimize the potential impact of any issues that do arise.

### Compliance with industry regulations and standards: 

Many industries have specific regulations and standards that software must adhere to. Software testing can help to ensure that the software meets these requirements and prevent potential legal issues or penalties.




## Validation and verification in software testing

Validation and verification are two critical concepts in software testing. Although these terms are often used interchangeably, they have different meanings.

Verification is the process of ensuring that the software meets the specified requirements. It involves checking whether the software is built according to the design and meets the desired functionality.

On the other hand, validation is the process of ensuring that the software meets the needs of the end-users or customers. It involves checking whether the software meets the desired functionality and can be used effectively by the end-users.

Software testing is an integral process in software development that ensures the software meets the desired quality standards. In this guide, we have introduced you to the fundamentals of software testing, which includes the different types of software tests, why testing is imperative, and the concept of validation and verification in software testing. By understanding these concepts, you can guarantee that your software is functional, dependable, and meets the needs of your end-users or customers.
