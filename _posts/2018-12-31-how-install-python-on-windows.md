# How to download python
To install Python, download Python 3.10 from [Python Official Site](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

I recommend you to download Python latest (Python 3.10.1) installer for Windows. If you have a different OS, download binaries accordingly. You may choose an x86-64 installer if you have a 64-bit system. Choose an x86 installer if you have a 32-bit system. But you can also click on the download button in the page header.

[x] It Extremely important: when you install it, make sure to check "Add Python to PATH".

# Install Python on Windows
After download, double click on downloaded item (.exe) It installation will begin.

- Next, it gives you a set of advanced options:
[x] Install for all users
[x] Associate files with Python (requires the py launcher)
[x] Create shortcuts for installed applications
[x] Add Python to environment variables
[x] Precompile standard library
[x] Download debugging symbols
[x] Download debug binaries (requires VS 2015 or later)
[x] You may also specify the location to install the directory at.

# Post Installation
You have now installed Python. Now, you can find a list of programs in the Start Menu.
Once Python is installed, you can execute the program "cmd.exe ". This is a command-line interface to your computer. Here, just type the word **python** and that will start the Python program.

You can use the Integrated DeveLopment Environment **(Python IDLE)** to code in Python which will be install during the installation, no need to install any fancy IDE. If you use the Python Shell, you can use it as an interpreter. Otherwise, you can create a new file to write a Python program. Later, you can save it and click ‘Run’ to run the program.

At all points during the course, you can always type python name_of_file.py and that will execute the code of a file called name_of_file.py

# Code Editor 
The best approach is to use an actual code editor. Some people prefer an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), but a far simpler code editor is much better for learning purposes.

Why? When you are learning something new you want to peel off as many layers of complexity as possible. Simplify things. By adding a complex IDE into the mix, which you will have to learn how to operate, you are just adding more and more layers, making the task - learning Python - even more difficult.

# Picking Up The Best Python IDE

A Python program, in its basic form, is simply lines of text (code) saved in a file with a .py file extension. Python code can be written in something as basic as Notepad - but there’s no reason to put yourself through such an ordeal since there are much better options available. At it’s core, a code editor should provide a number of features that help a programmer create programs (Python scripts and modules, in our case). In most cases, code editors allow the user to customize the program itself, to suit your needs and style.

# What should you look for in a code editor?
- Ease of use
- Syntax highlighting
- Auto-indentation
- Tabbed views
- Line numbering
- Ability to customize the look and feel of the editor
- Availability of add-ons
- Code Formatting 

# Which one should I pick?

I've tried tens of python IDE over the years. where I found some are very useful & handy. These are my favourites:

- Most Popular Python IDE

1. Anaconda Python IDE: [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
2. PyCharm IDE:  [Download Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
3. Pydev :  [Download Pycharm](https://www.pydev.org/)

- Light Weight Python IDE 
1. Visual Studio Code :  [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. Sublime Text :  [Download Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
3. Notepad ++ :  [Download Notepad ++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)

Use Any of them as concindering your system compatability.
Or you can just use your Built in Python IDLE with Python Installer no hassel.
