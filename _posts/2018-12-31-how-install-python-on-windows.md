Python is an interpreted programming language that may be used for web development, machine learning, and complicated data processing. Python is often regarded as one of the easiest programming languages to learn for a novice. You might use it as a Software Testing Professional to automate your day-to-day work.

# How to download python

Installing Python on your system is the first step to becoming a Python developer. There are many ways you can get started with setup and installation: you can download official Python distributions from [Python Official Site](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- I propose that you download the most recent Python installer for Windows (Python 3.10.7).

  - If you have a different operating system, download binaries for it.
  - If you have a 64-bit machine, you can select an x86-64 installer.
  - If you have a 32-bit machine, select an x86 installation. However, you may also download by clicking on the download button in the page header..

   It Extremely important: when you install it, make sure to check **Add Python to PATH**.

# Install Python on Windows 11 or Windows 10

After downloading, double-click the downloaded item (.exe) to begin installation.

- Next, it gives you a set of advanced options:
- [x] Install for all users
- [x] Associate files with Python (requires the py launcher)
- [x] Create shortcuts for installed applications
- [x] Add Python to environment variables
- [x] Precompile standard library
- [x] Download debugging symbols
- [x] Download debug binaries (requires VS 2015 or later)
- [x] You may also specify the location to install the directory at.

# Post Installation
Python is now installed. Now you should see a list of programs in the start menu.

After installing Python, you can run the cmd.exe program. This is a command line interface to your computer. Just type **python** here and the Python program will start.

You can use the integrated development environment (Python IDLE) to code in Python, which is installed during installation, without having to install an advanced IDE. If you're using a Python shell, you can use it as your interpreter. Otherwise, you can create a new file to create your Python program. You can save it later and run the program by clicking Run.

You can always type python name_of_file.py at any point during the course. This will run code from a file named **name_of_file.py.**

# Python Code Editor 

The best way is to use a real code editor. Some people prefer an integrated development environment (IDE), but a much simpler code editor is better for learning purposes.

why? When learning something new, you want to peel off as many layers of complexity as possible. Simplify things. Adding a complex IDE to the mix that you have to learn to use just adds more layers and makes the Python learning task even more difficult.

# Picking Up The Best Python IDE

A Python program, in its basic form, is a simple line of text (code) stored in a file with the .py file extension. Python code can be written in something as simple as Notepad, but there are far better options out there, so there's no reason to go through such an ordeal. Basically, a code editor should provide a set of features that help programmers create programs (in this case, Python scripts and modules). In most cases, code editors allow users to customize programs to suit their own needs and style.

# What should you look for in a code editor?
- Ease of use
- Syntax highlighting
- Auto-indentation
- Tabbed views
- Line numbering
- Ability to customize the look and feel of the editor
- Availability of add-ons
- Code Formatting 

# Which one should I pick?

I've tried tens of python IDE over the years. where I found some are very useful & handy. These are my favourites:

- Most Popular Python IDE

1. Anaconda Python IDE: [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
2. PyCharm IDE:  [Download Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
3. Pydev :  [Download Pycharm](https://www.pydev.org/)

- Light Weight Python IDE 
1. Visual Studio Code :  [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. Sublime Text :  [Download Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
3. Notepad ++ :  [Download Notepad ++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)

Use Any of them as concindering your system compatability.
Or you can just use your Built in Python IDLE with Python Installer no hassel.
