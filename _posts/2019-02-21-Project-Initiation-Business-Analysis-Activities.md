**Pre-Project Activities**

# What is project initiation?

The project initiation phase is the first step of the project management life cycle because it involves the start of a new project. The business problem or opportunity is identified during the initiation phase, a solution is defined, a project is formed, and a project team is appointed to build and deliver the solution to the customer.

# Why is it important?

The start phase is not only a nice-to-have in project management; it is a required and, more importantly, decisive step in which the project is either approved or rejected.

- During this phase, important choices that set the project's direction and resource requirements, such as the project charter and the selection of project stakeholders, are made. The stakeholders agree on a clear goal to guarantee that everyone is on the same page about how the project should continue.
- There will be numerous inspections throughout and after project execution to prevent confusion and guarantee the project continues on track. However, valuable time and money may be squandered, which is undesirable.
- Effective project management necessitates maximizing benefits while minimizing expenses while providing 'value' to the customer. Having a defined project purpose will assist you in accomplishing all of this.


Starting a new project is thrilling, but before you get started, make sure that your endeavor will genuinely provide value. That's where project initiation comes inâ€”it provides a methodical strategy to demonstrating your project's business case and demonstrating that the work you'll accomplish is doable. Project initiation also guarantees that you involve stakeholders early on, allowing you to obtain critical resources, establish visibility for your project, and avoid costly bottlenecks later on.
