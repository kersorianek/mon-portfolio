The bug life cycle is often referred to as the defect life cycle. It is Bug's (Software Bug) journey through many stages of it's existence. Suppose the software is governed by a testing procedure and is dependent on testing tools. This cycle varies by organization and project.

Let's have a look at the various stages of a bug's life cycle:

# New:

A test engineer at a software testing organization noticed a mistake and marked it as "new." This error is still being researched and approved.

A new error may be assigned, dropped, or deferred.

# Assigned:

After the test engineer posts the bug, the test team leader confirms it and sends it to the development team. There are two probable scenarios. 
 - The first is that the fault can be directly traced to the developer, who is responsible for the error's effectiveness. 
 - Second, it can be allocated to the developer, who, after approved by the lead leadership, can take the error to the developer.

# Open / Active:

It begins when a developer begins studying and repairing a bug.


# Test / Fix:

It can be called "Fixed" when a developer replaces the relevant code and fixes the bug by confirming the changes.


# Retest / Verify:

At this point, the tester reviews the changed code provided by the developer to ensure that the mistake has been fixed. When the most recent build is installed in the test environment, the testing team knows that the Devil errors are ready for testing.

# Reopen:

If the bug still exists after the developer has fixed it, the tester switches the status to "Reopen." The bug goes through its life cycle once more.

# Deferred:

Delaying the bug indicates that it will be fixed in the future version. There are several reasons why bugs alter this scenario. These include issue priority, a shortage of release time, and the influence on bug software.

# Dropped / Rejected:

If the developer thinks that the bug is not logical or correct, then the developer rejects the bug. Then the condition of the bug becomes "Rejected".

# Duplicate:

If the developer believes that the bug is illogical or incorrect, the bug is rejected. The bug's status then changes to "Rejected."

# Closed:

The tester verifies that the bug has been rectified. If the tester believes that the bug is no longer present in the software, the tester "closes" the bug's status. This indicates that the bug has been resolved, tested, and approved.

# Not a bug / Enhancement:

If the application's functionality remains unchanged, it is marked as "Not a bug / Enhancement." For example, if a customer wants to alter the color of some text, this is not a bug, but rather a minor tweak in the application's design.
