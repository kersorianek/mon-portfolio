Why Dashboards Don’t Get Used — and What We Can Do About It

After a few years working as a data analyst in consulting, I started noticing a pattern:
Even well-designed dashboards sometimes go completely unused.
At first, I thought: maybe the analysis wasn’t helpful enough. But the more I worked across projects, the clearer it became — the gap wasn’t just technical. It was often in expectations, communication, and context.

Here are the top three reasons I’ve seen why dashboards get ignored, and how I’ve learned to respond:

1. Data quality issues: business stops trusting the numbers
If a dashboard is out-of-date, misaligned with business understanding, or inconsistent with other data sources, stakeholders will simply stop using it.

This is often not the analyst’s fault — the root causes could be upstream data issues, broken pipelines, or inconsistent input logic.
But from the stakeholder’s perspective, “the dashboard is wrong.”

📌 What I do:

Set up a transparent issue log and keep stakeholders updated on progress and timelines;

Offer simple explanations of how the data flows — especially for system-level issues;

If the root cause is manual input or operational inconsistencies, I support teams in defining input standards and light data validation practices.

Data analysts aren’t here to take the blame — but we can help everyone understand what went wrong and how we’ll fix it.

2. The output doesn’t answer the real business question
A common case:
Business wants to know why users are churning.
The analyst returns a breakdown of churn rates. Technically complete — but business still doesn't know what to do next.

📌 One example from my work: In an international payments project, I noticed that each day a large number of users were interacting with the auto-debit (direct debit) feature — almost the same volume as new users. This hinted at stagnation in net user growth.

By linking together behavioral data (subscription sign-ups, cancellations, debit attempts, customer service interactions), and supporting it with survey responses, we discovered:

Many users authorized auto-debit when signing up (e.g., for video subscriptions),

But forgot about it, and when they saw a future charge, couldn’t trace where it came from,

This created a sense of insecurity, leading them to cancel the feature.

We recommended:

Adding payment reminders before deductions,

Making billing pages clearer with more specific charge details.

In this case, the value came not from showing what happened, but explaining why — and giving a solution that could actually be implemented.

3. The presentation is too technical or too overwhelming
Terms like p-values, confidence intervals, or overly dense visuals (like Sankey diagrams or complex heatmaps) can easily confuse non-technical stakeholders.

📌 How I approach this:

Keep the language clean and avoid jargon when possible;

Show key takeaways before visuals, not after;

Ask myself: “If I were in the business team, would I know what to do after seeing this slide?”

✨ In short:
Sometimes dashboards fail not because the analysis is wrong — but because the gap between data and business action is still too wide.

As data analysts, our role isn’t just to produce charts.
It’s to build understanding, trust, and ultimately — action.
