Business analysis is not the type of job where you need to be prepared for everything, but you should be prepared for the odd surprise or unexpected event. Most business analyst jobs will provide you with a reasonable bit of variation in your day-to-day work. While this is not an IT support function that requires near-constant interaction with people and real-time prioritization, priorities change and a certain level of flexibility and responsiveness is required. Of course, if your company suffers a disaster or discovers a huge unanticipated opportunity, you will most certainly be called in to assist on short notice, but this is the exception rather than the rule.

Most of the time, your days will strike you instead than the other way around. The top business analysts drive the requirements process. This includes organizing meetings, handling input, influencing stakeholders, and ensuring decisions are made. Great business analysts are proactive in their search for answers. If this is not a comfortable job for you, you may be able to locate opportunities where you can collaborate with a strong project manager. In general, you should be prepared to organize your own work to meet deadlines (sometimes set by yourself, possibly imposed) and to facilitate input and occasionally follow-ups from a range of people to achieve your ultimate goals.
