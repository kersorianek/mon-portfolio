# Current State of the Industry
The demand for IT Business Analysts is high and expected to grow by 14% from 2020 to 2030, which is much faster than the average for all occupations. The reasons for this growth are manifold. 

First, organizations increasingly rely on technology to streamline their operations, making Business Analysts a vital part of the IT team. 

Second, the emergence of Big Data and the Internet of Things (IoT) has created new opportunities for IT Business Analysts to analyze data and recommend business strategies. 

Third, digital transformation is a priority for most organizations, which has led to an increase in demand for IT Business Analysts.

## Skills and Qualifications Required for a Business Analyst
Business Analysts must have a combination of technical and soft skills. Technical skills include proficiency in data modeling, database design, business intelligence tools, and software development methodologies such as Agile or Scrum. On the other hand, soft skills such as communication, problem-solving, and project management are equally important. A bachelor's degree in computer science, information technology, business administration, or a related field is the minimum educational requirement. Additionally, certification in business analysis, such as Certified Business Analysis Professional (CBAP), is highly recommended.

## Salary Ranges of a Business Analyst

According to data from Glassdoor, the average base salary for an business analyst in the US is $71,925 per year. However, the salary range for business analysts varies widely depending on several factors, including location, experience, and industry. For example,  business analysts working in metropolitan areas such as San Francisco or New York City typically earn higher salaries than those working in smaller cities or rural areas.

In terms of experience, entry-level business analysts can expect to earn an average base salary of $60,000 per year, while those with 5-10 years of experience can expect to earn an average base salary of $85,000 per year. Individuals with over 10 years of experience can earn upwards of $100,000 per year.

Industry also plays a significant role in determining salary ranges for business analysts. According to data from Glassdoor, the highest paying industries for business analysts are finance and technology, with average base salaries of $82,000 and $80,000 per year, respectively. Other industries that pay IT business analysts well include healthcare, retail, and manufacturing.

Several other factors can impact the salary range for business analysts, including company size and education level. Larger companies tend to offer higher salaries than smaller ones, while individuals with advanced degrees such as a Master of Business Administration (MBA) or a Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS) can command higher salaries than those with only a bachelor's degree.
