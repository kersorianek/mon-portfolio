    <!-- Application Structure Plan:
        The SPA is designed as a single-page application with a fixed sidebar navigation and a main content area. This structure allows users to easily navigate between different topics of the report.
        Sections include:
        1.  Overview: Introduces the problem and the solution's purpose.
        2.  Why Feature Selection?: Highlights benefits.
        3.  Key Evaluation Metrics: Explains Missing Data, Target Relationship, and Predictive Power with illustrative charts. This helps users understand the 'building blocks' of the decision.
        4.  The Composite Score: Details the formula and allows interactive adjustment of weights to see their impact on a hypothetical example. This promotes understanding of the scoring mechanism.
        5.  The Algorithm in Action: Shows the Python code and a conceptual flowchart of its steps, making the technical implementation transparent.
        6.  Interactive Explorer: A simplified demo where users input scores for two hypothetical correlated features and see which one would be kept based on the composite score and current weights. This provides a hands-on learning experience.
        7.  Advanced Tips: Summarizes best practices.
        8.  Conclusion: Key takeaways.
        This multi-section, guided approach was chosen to break down complex information into digestible parts, facilitating progressive understanding and engagement, rather than mirroring the linear structure of the source report.

                <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    Welcome! This guide explores a sophisticated method for removing highly correlated features from a dataset. In machine learning, dealing with multicollinearity (where features are highly correlated) is crucial for building robust and interpretable models.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Traditional methods often remove one feature from a correlated pair arbitrarily. This interactive application, based on the "Optimal Python Function for Highly Correlated Feature Removal" report, introduces a multi-criteria approach. It uses a composite score based on:

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Feature selection is a vital preprocessing step in machine learning. Its main goal is to identify and keep only the most relevant features from your dataset. This process offers several significant benefits:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 pl-4 space-y-2 leading-relaxed bg-stone-50 p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
                    <li><strong class="text-teal-600">Enhances Model Efficacy:</strong> By removing irrelevant or redundant features, models can often achieve better predictive accuracy and generalize better to new, unseen data.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-teal-600">Reduces Computational Overhead:</strong> Fewer features mean less data to process, leading to faster model training and prediction times. This is especially important for large datasets.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-teal-600">Improves Model Interpretability:</strong> Models with fewer features are generally easier to understand and explain. It becomes clearer which factors are driving the predictions.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-teal-600">Mitigates Overfitting:</strong> Redundant or irrelevant features can sometimes cause models to "memorize" the training data (overfit) rather than learning general patterns, leading to poor performance on new data.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-teal-600">Addresses Multicollinearity:</strong> Specifically, removing highly correlated features (which provide similar information) helps stabilize model coefficients and makes it easier to understand the individual contribution of each feature.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                    Ultimately, effective feature selection leads to more efficient, robust, and understandable machine learning models.

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    The proportion of missing values in a feature is a direct indicator of its completeness and reliability. Features with a high percentage of missing data are generally less informative and can complicate model training, even if imputation techniques are used.

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>Calculation:</strong> For each feature, it's `(Number of Null/NaN values) / (Total number of rows)`.

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    The strength of a feature's relationship with the target variable is crucial. Features that strongly predict or associate with the target are more valuable. The specific statistical measure used depends on the data types of the feature and the target (e.g., Pearson correlation for numeric-numeric, ANOVA F-value for numeric-categorical, Mutual Information for mixed types).

                    This metric assesses how well a single feature, on its own, can predict the target variable. For classification tasks, this is often represented by the Lift Ratio, calculated from a simple model trained only on that feature. For regression tasks, R-squared from a simple linear regression can be used.

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    To make an informed decision about which feature to remove from a highly correlated group, individual scores (missing proportion, target correlation, predictive power) are combined into a single composite removal score. These individual scores are first normalized (typically to a 0-1 range).

                    <li>
                        <strong class="text-teal-600">Performance Optimization:</strong> For very large datasets, calculating predictive power for each feature can be slow. Consider using vectorized operations, sampling, or tools like Numba/Cython if performance is critical.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong class="text-teal-600">Sensitivity Analysis & Threshold Tuning:</strong> The `corr_threshold` for grouping features and the weights for the composite score are key hyperparameters. Experiment with different values and use cross-validation to assess their impact on your specific model and data. There's no one-size-fits-all.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong class="text-teal-600">Handling Edge Cases:</strong> Be mindful of features with zero variance (constant values), as they can cause issues in calculations. The function should ideally handle these by assigning default scores. Also, consider how non-numeric data (like dates or free text) is handled; they might need preprocessing or exclusion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong class="text-teal-600">Outliers:</strong> Extreme outliers can affect Pearson correlation and Min-Max scaling. If your data has significant outliers, explore robust scaling methods or outlier treatment before applying this function.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong class="text-teal-600">Data Understanding:</strong> Always start with a thorough understanding of your dataset—feature distributions, potential issues, and the nature of your target variable. This context is vital for interpreting the results of any automated feature selection process.

                    The multi-criteria approach for removing highly correlated features offers a more data-driven and nuanced solution than simpler methods. By considering missingness, target relevance, and individual predictive power, it aims to retain the most valuable features within correlated groups.

                    <li><strong>Understand Your Data:</strong> Deeply analyze your dataset before applying any automated selection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Experiment with Parameters:</strong> Tune the correlation threshold and score weights to fit your specific project needs.
