# Requirement Elicitation Basics 

Eliciting requirements is the process of determining what the system is doing and what the system should be doing. Not knowing what to do. The requirements process begins with elicitation.

## What Requirement Elicitation is?

Requirement Elicitation is the process of gathering business requirements from users and stakeholders through various activities and being able to establish their expectations as well as understand their system constraints.

- So it's really all about getting them,
- Interacting with them,
- Asking them well-thought-out questions to find out what their needs are for this specific product, system, or process, 
- and understanding what they're doing today
- and what they need for it to work in the future, and so on.

## What Requirement Elicitation is not? 

Requirement Elicitation is the process of developing a large number of models and working through them to determine how things will be completed. After requirement elicitation, the system's operation or buttons, UI, and so on will be defined.

There are three further processes after elicitation to develop those requirements, to massage them, to bring them together, and to make them ready for the design phase.

## Requirement Elicitation VS Requirement Gathering

Gathering requirements is similar to Taking orders in a restaurant. Customers already know what the system is supposed to accomplish, and you're simply writing it down. There is no room for doubt. Nothing can go wrong; everything is simple.


But the things are not the way it is.

You must be able to ask valid questions, elicit needs from users and stakeholders, and record those requirements. That sounds like hard labor. That is why it is termed eliciting rather than gathering requirements.

# Requirement Elicitation Technique

There are several approaches you may use to go through and pull requirements from stakeholders, documents, and so on.

And this will identify all those different technique. _Each technique has their benefits, advantages, and disadvantages and some best practices well._ So let's get into the first particular technique and this is brainstorming.

 ## Brainstorming: Elicitation Technique
 

Brainstorming is used in requirement capturing to acquire as many ideas from a group of individuals as feasible. Generally used to find potential answers to issues and to explain specifics of possibilities.

It was invented in 1953 by advertising executive Alex Osborn, brainstorming is a creative approach used by groups of people to develop ideas to solve a specific problem.


So you may use brainstorming to help solve an existing problem that may have arisen very early stages of the project, in the middle of the project, or towards the end of the project.

It might also be to generate thoughts and ideas, which is a common misperception or perspective held by many people. Gather in a room to brainstorm alternative solutions to a problem or to achieve an agreement.

## What are the different kinds of brainstorming?

1. The first type is an **individual brainstorms**. As a result, a project team member compiles a list of ideas. It's more like you submitted them a question or a problem, and then they brainstormed solutions.

2. The second method is **open brainstorming**, which is the most popular. So, you get folks in a room and just say, OK, here's the agenda, here's the problem, here's what we're going to do. You start with something and then let them go, and people start chatting, tossing ideas around, and becoming enthusiastic. Other people are feeding off the ideas that are being spoken, and you're just kind of rolling, with a scribe writing everything. As the business analyst, you may be that person. Hopefully not. You'd want to provide some of those brainstorming thoughts.

3. The last type is a **structured brainstorming** session. So, participants are jotting down their thoughts, and then a facilitator goes around the room one by one. They'll go around the table until everyone has exhausted their whole list of ideas. The work is organized such that people (shy, afraid, or experienced) may feel comfortable sharing their views.
   

## What are the advantage and disadvantage of Brainstorming?

**Why would you use this elicitation method?**

### Advantage of Brainstorming:
 - It creates a lot of ideas quickly, especially if you have an open brainstorming session.
 - If you've done a good job of bringing in the proper stakeholders and people for the brainstorming session, you'll receive multiple perspectives.
 - It promotes equal participation. Whether in an organized or unstructured atmosphere.
 - It assists in avoiding biases toward any one point of view.
 - It develops companionship and a sense of ownership.

### Disadvantage of Brainstorming:

- One big thing is ideas aren't discussed or explored - just get lots of ideas out of the way and start looking at them.
- You don't really dive into it, so that's kind of one of the cons. As well as the true meaning of that idea could be ambiguous or misunderstood.
- And high level of discussion can cause some issue there.
- Some dump suggestions may be allowed for evaluation as well
- It is possible for ideas to overlap.
- Some emotional and environmental mental impediments may occur, such as dissatisfaction with chaos, fear of criticism, and the continuation of wrong assumptions.

## Brainstorming Best Practices:

- ✅ Determine type of brainstorming meeting ahead of time
- ✅ Publish an agenda prior to the brainstorming session
- ✅ Clearly state the objective of the meeting
- ✅ Create environment to encourage participation
- ✅ Establish ground rules:
  - Do not discuss ideas during the brainstorming session – only questions to clarify
  - Do not dismiss or discount an idea or person
  - Do build on others’ suggestions and ideas
  - Do have fun
- ✅ Establish roles:
  - Timekeeper
  - Scribe
  - Facilitator
- ✅ Create process for combining, categorizing, and summarizing like ideas
- ✅ If complex, create multiple meetings to keep meeting fatigue low
- ✅ Schedule follow-up meetings
- ✅ Prioritize final ideas to plan further analysis
- ✅ Allow votes for top ideas

# Requirement Workshop: Elicitation Technique

The first thing is, what is a requirement workshop?

Ultimately, it's a structured meeting that involves multiple different groups and users. So it involves the end users, your subject matter experts, both that could be from the business, it also could be from the technology side the IT side. Any type of business people that are going to be making decisions.

So if you have teams in different departments that are having this solution that's going to meet both of their needs, this requirement elicitation technique is nice to build to get them in the room and work through and hash out some of the requirements.

This type of elicitation techniques pulls those groups together and allows you to ask the question to get both sides verify and validate that the requirements don't conflict each other and come to a consensus much quicker. So it's working to define, clarify and complete requirements as most of the elicitation techniques are.

So you start this meeting at a really broad level. You have an agenda, a topic that you're looking to identify and attack. We learned in the brainstorming elicitation, you're not really coming up with the final requirements, right? You're just getting ideas and you're not diving into the details. Requirement workshop is the exact opposite. You should be diving into the details, you should be coming down and making some decisions based on the information that's gathered.

So there's a few different types of requirement workshop, a lot of it it's more around what you're looking to gather and the type of project you have.

The first type is a **formal requirements workshop**. So this is a highly structured and formal meeting where you invite the stakeholders, you have a really strict agenda that you're looking to follow and you're having a formal sit down meeting that you're going to discuss these requirements. You also have a carefully selected group of stakeholders, you want to make sure that you're adding people that have value and that are going to provide good input to the project and to this particular requirement discussion without derailing it.

Ultimately, what that means is you're identifying, validating, clarifying and finalizing some requirements and getting those documented in the requirements document. That's the most common workshop.

So the next one is the process, the **business process improvement workshop**. This one, you're actually diving into a specific process, it could be their as-is process, it could be you know, you could be diving into their as-is process and you're working to help mold that into the to-be process. And so you have them in the room and you're going to be doing, you're going to be working through and identifying what those process improvements are.

You write the action or event on (Sticky Note) there and stick it on the board. And they say OK, what do you do next and you put that on the board, so ultimately on the board, what you have is this kind of process flow out of the post-it notes and then you're able to move them around, if people aren't agreeing you can move around without having to erase or redraw anything, it's very easy to move them around.

The third one is **agile requirements workshops**. you can kind of guess, that's utilized in an agile environment. And those are usually a little bit more unstructured and informal. So as you know, with agile you have to kind of the product backlog and the requirements as part of the sprint that you're working through. This is generally used at the beginning of the project to understand with the full scope is and start to write out some of those initial requirements that will be used as part of the project.

## So, what are some of the advantages and disadvantages, the pros and cons of using this?

## So, looking at the advantages,

it helps you actually really get into the details and there are the real requirements, it's not perceived requirements or guessed out requirements like brainstorming. You have decision makers. Also, you have a better chance of valid requirement and creating consensus. In addition, the requirement accuracy from these are much quicker and also you're able to get that confirmation.

You can pull a big group of people together and gather good requirements and document right after it because of the structure of the requirement workshop. We are able to document that out and send that out to the group for their review and to send back in case you captured anything incorrectly. So it's a little bit more immediate both in decisions, as well as feedback back to the users. You kind of show them how they have helped.

## So what are some disadvantages?

Well, it's hard to get the right stakeholders in the room at the same time and this goes for any type of meeting. You're pulling in a lot of different stakeholders from a lot of different divisions, departments, levels to be able to get all of them available for an hour or two hours to have a requirements workshop is difficult. So it is little bit harder. And expensive too. Also, there are some logistical issues due to location. The next thing is as a disadvantage is the facilitator needs to be strong because if they don't do a good job facilitating, if they don't do a good job of guiding the discussion, the discussion can go off track and waste everyone's time.

## So, what are some best practices?

And these are best practices that We can come up with in utilizing requirement workshops. It help in those projects that are larger in size when they have multiple groups that can bring the groups together.

Number one thing is, you need to determine the type of workshop ahead of time. In addition, as always when you're getting a group of people together you want to be very clear on what the objective of that meeting is and be very clear on what that session will deliver in the end.

- What are the end deliverables?
- How will it help?
- And what problems are you ultimately solving?
- Why did you bring all these people together to have this discussion?
  It's really important for everybody to understand what everybody else is talking about and the best way and you've heard it a probably a million times, as _a visual or a picture is worth a thousand words_, and that really rings true here.

Writing requirement in word, you can definitely do that in a smart way. But writing that in a way that everybody can understand within a meeting can be a little bit difficult, so it's nice to use some type of visual models, whether it's the post-it notes to identify that process or whether you're creating some quick models, a Venn diagram or maybe just a quick view of kind of a visualization of that requirement how that could be solved.

The next thing everyone kind of alluded to this, the facilitator should be experienced, you shouldn't be throwing a junior.

The next thing is don't invite everybody. You need to make sure grabbing one or two people out of those key areas and pull them into the room. Target between 8 to 12 people.

The last thing is you need to remember you're an analyst, not a facilitator, so you're not there to take the order. You need to be bringing your experience and expertise to the table and kind of working through and massaging these requirements.

If there's requirements that are conflicting with other requirements, call that out in this meeting, this is the perfect time to address those conflicting requirements and to come up with a solution for it.

# Interviewing: Elicitation Technique

What is interviewing?
It is like job interview but here you will be interviewing your stakeholders through a structured question to identify and elicit requirement.

- Systematic discussion to drive out accurate requirements quickly
- Gain understanding of high-level needs, constraints, and assumptions
- Reduces misunderstanding due to cultural differences, lack of openness, and acronyms/vocabulary
- One on one or with a small group
- Can be formal or informal
- See the process or requirements from interviewee’s perspective

## Types of interviewing?

- Personal interviews:
  - Scripted questions – interviewee’s answers are documented
  - Exploratory questions to clarify and validate requirements, while removing assumptions
- Job shadowing:
  - Walk through a work day with a user or user group observing them
- Customer site visits:
  - Understand operational environment to discover prerequisites for job success
- Task analysis:
  - Ask end-users to walk through their current jobs
  - Show as-is process in order to identify essential and frequent tasks
  - Interviewer asks questions to understand what works well and what doesn’t

## What are the pros and cons of Interviewing?

Advantage:

- Promote interactive discussions to explore detailed information
- Identify conflicts or discrepancies about stated needs or requirements
- Encourage participation and build relationships by establishing rapport with the stakeholder
- Enable observations of nonverbal behavior
- Allow immediate follow-up to ensure understanding
  Disadvantage:
- Require access and commitment of stakeholders
- Creation of scripted interview questions can be time consuming
- Stakeholders have difficulty describing their future needs, so the focus is usually focused on what they do currently
- Resulting documentation is subject to interpretation of the interviewer
- Transcription and analysis of interview data can be complex and expensive

## Some best practices of Interviewing?

- Determine the best interview type to accomplish your goals
- Appropriately prepare for the interview
- Schedule interviews ahead of time
- Respect the person by being on time and display interest in the subject
- Match the pace of the interviewee
  - If they are cautious, talk slow. If they are in a hurry, talk quickly
- Check understanding often
- Let interviewee know what will be done with the information
- One person conducts interview while the other documents the answers. If not possible, record the interview.
- Ask for examples of their issues and document screen shots
- Interview two to three users for each user category you are targeting
- Be sure to interview end-users, not just senior management who think they know how the process/system is used
- Create thank-you email appreciating their time and how the information will help create quality requirements – (sent with interview invite)
- Create a follow-up email telling the person how the information will be used and the next steps for the project – (sent after interview)
- Allow time in the schedule to debrief and finish documentation after each interview
  Interview Questions?
- Make questions open-ended
  - If they could answer the question with a yes or no, reword it
- Avoid questions that may present judgement or a conclusion
- Allow the questions to flow naturally so they can be put into conversation rather than a survey

Create Interview Document (That Generally Contains):

- Name of interviewee
- Role of person and their primary responsibilities
- Open-ended questions
- Space for answers
- Space for interviewers’ insights
- Action item box for flagging key pieces of information
- Requirement, new requirement risk, assumption, or constraint

## Sample Interviewing Question:

- What are other ways you accomplish this goal?
- Tell me about your frustrations with this process
- What makes a good day? A bad day?
- If you could wave your magic wand and make it different, what would the process look like?
- What standards or regulations should we be aware of?
- What purpose is accomplished by using the product or process?
- What equipment, tools, templates, and inputs do people need to use it?
- How long should tasks take?
- What people do you share information with?
- What failures cause the organization the most pain?
- What didn’t I ask that I should have?
- If we could only change one thing in the process, what should it be

# Surveys: Elicitation Technique

What is Survey?

- Questions to stakeholders to quantify their thoughts
- Review of quantifiable data already available.

## Types of Survey?

- Open Ended Questions:
  - Gives respondents an opportunity to answer in their own words
  - Useful, but very time consuming to interpret and catalogue.
- Closed Ended Questions:
  - Finite set of answers for each question
  - Lends itself to statistical analysis
  - Tough to create questions that are not leading or need an “Other” answer
  - Questions can vary:
  - Ranking from “not very important” to “extremely important”
  - Ranking from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”
  - Rank order a list of items
  - Multiple choice question
  ## What are some pros and cons:
  Advantage:
- Require limited stakeholder’s time
- Effective at reaching geographically dispersed stakeholders
- Scalable for large audiences
- Relatively fast and inexpensive to administer
- Supplement more subjective information, such as opinions gained through interviews

Disadvantage:

- Relatively low response rate
- Poorly word questions may provide inaccurate information
- Use of open-ended questions requirements more analysis by the business analyst
- Require both instrument training and problem or business domain experience
- Incentives for responding might be expensive

## What are some best Practices?

- Focus your questions on high-priority risks that have been identified
- Identify user satisfaction levels with existing systems to set a baseline
- Questions should be direct and unambiguous
- Save complex questions for later in the survey
- Save demographic information for last
- Create rewards for participating
- Create the survey with inexpensive online tools
- Notify the participants when the survey is available and continue to remind them to participate

# Document Review: Elicitation Technique

What is Document Review?

- Review existing documentation:
  - User guides
  - Prior system implementation documentation, including lessons learned
  - Technical documentation
  - Lessons learned after completion of latest project
- Formulates context for understanding the scope of the project

## What are some pros and cons:

Advantage:

- Current process documentation provides a starting point

Disadvantage:

- Existing documents may be old and out-of-date
- The reviewer needs domain and technical expertise to determine if existing
- Can be time consuming, and may not provide the desired payback

What are some best practices?

- Know the purpose for reviewing
- Set self-imposed time limits
- Create a glossary of terms from former project documentation

# Interface Analysis: Elicitation Technique

What is Interface Analysis?

- Reviewing the system, people, and process linkages
- Determine needs for input, output, and the medium
- Describes manual and automated processes

Analyzing Interface Time:

- Customer review meetings:
  - Identify formal requirements to link information, people, and processes
  - Drives a robust, complete, and accurate solution
- Developer review meetings:
  - Happen early on
  - Review high-level requirements and system models
  - Identify interfaces, regulations, or technical standards
    What are some pros and cons:
    Advantage:
- Discovers missed interfaces and their purposes
- Determines regulations or interface standards
- Provides missed requirements
- Uncovers areas of project risk
  Disadvantage:
- Not useful as standalone elicitation activity
- Can begin to focus on many technical details
- Can be redundant with modeling activities

What are some best practices?

- Know the purpose for reviewing
- Set self-imposed time limits
- Create a glossary of terms from former project documentation
