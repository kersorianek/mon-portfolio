Testing is a process, not a single action. This procedure starts with test planning and concludes with test case design, execution, and evaluation. As a result, the basic functions of the testing process can be divided into many steps:

1. Planning & Control
2. Analysis & Design
3. Implementation & Execution
4. Evaluating Exit Criteria & Reporting
5. Test Closing Activities

Let's learn more about the different steps of testing activity:

# Planning & Control

1.1) The primary functions of test planning are as follows:

1. 1. Determination of test scope and risk, as well as establishment of testing objectives.
2. To select a testing method
3. Policy and strategy implementation testing:
    - A test strategy is a plan that describes a phase of the software development life cycle. It is intended to educate project managers, testers, and developers on some of the most important parts of the testing process.These include test objectives, test processes, overall project time and labor necessary, and testing environment.
4. Determining the necessary test resources, such as people, test environment, PC, Smartphone, and so on.
5. Test Analysis and Test Implementation, Execution, and Evaluation Schedule
6. Establish the departure criteria. Criteria such as coverage criteria must be established.
   - Coverage Criteria is the percentage of program statements that should be completed during the test. This will assist us in determining whether or not we are carrying out the test activities correctly.

1.2) The following are the primary tasks performed in test control:

1. Assess and evaluate the review and testing outcomes.
2. Monitoring and documenting test coverage and exit criteria progress.
3. Provide test results.
4. Begin corrective actions.
5. Making the decisions.

# Analysis and design

The primary functions of test analysis and design are as follows:

1. Examine the test basis. 
   - The knowledge needed to begin test analysis and develop our own test case is the test's foundation. It is the document that serves as the foundation for the test case, such as the requirement, design specification, product risk analysis, architecture, and interface. Utilizing the Test Basis Document We know what the system should do once we've built it.
2. Determine the test circumstances.
3. Design of the test.
4. Assess the system's requirements and testability.
5. Create the test environment setup and determine the infrastructure and equipment required.

# Implementation and Execution:

  We accept the test conditions in the test case and method, as well as other tests such as automation script, test environment, and any other test infrastructure, throughout the implementation and application of the test. A **test case** is a collection of criteria that an examiner uses to determine whether or not an application is functioning properly.

3.1) The following tasks are completed during test implementation:

1. Using approaches, we create test data and develop and prioritize our test cases.
- Most feature testing need you to enter data into a software application. Test data is the uniquely identifiable data utilized in the test.)

The test method provides also some instructions for running tests that we write.
We may need to use automated test scripts and test harnesses to automate some tests.

A test harness is a bundle of software and test data used to monitor the behavior and outcomes of various program units running in various conditions.

1. Develop a test suit for effective test execution based on the test scenario. (A test suite is a collection of test cases that each contain a specific set of behaviors in a software program.) The system setup of the test suite frequently provides specific instructions and information for each group of test cases to be used during the test.)
2. To set up and test the test environment.

3.2) The following tasks are completed during test execution is:
1. To carry out test suites and individual test cases in accordance with the test procedure.
2. Repeat the test to ensure that any previously failed tests have been corrected. This is referred to as confirmation or re-testing.
3. To record the identification and version of the program under test, as well as the results of the test application. 
   - Used to audit test logs. The test log describes what was tested, why it was tested, who performed the test, and what the test case's state is (pass/fail). These comments are documented and referred to as test logs.
4. To compare the real and projected results.
5. To disclose discrepancies as facts when actual and expected results differ.

# Exit criteria and report evaluation:

Based on the project risk assessment, we will establish criteria for each test level against which "test adequacy" will be measured. These criteria, known as departure criteria, differ from project to project. When: 
- Most test cases are completed with a specific pass rate, the exit criteria come into play.
- The bug rate falls below a particular threshold.
- Shows up on time for the project.

The main tasks in the exit criteria assessment are:

1. To compare the test logs to the exit criteria specified in the test plan.
2. Whether more tests are required to evaluate whether the specific departure criteria should be amended.
3. Create a test summary report for stakeholders.

# Test closing activities:

After the program has been given, test closure operations are carried out. Testing may be halted for a variety of reasons, including: [] when all necessary information for the test has been gathered.
 [x] When a project is terminated.
 [x] When a specific aim is met.
 [x] When a maintenance release or update has been finished.
The tasks that need to be done in the test closure activity are:

1. To ensure that all incident reports have been resolved and that all planned deliverables have been given.
2. To complete and store testware reuse items such as test scripts, test environments, and so on.
3. Hand over the test equipment to the maintenance team. They will provide software assistance.
4. To assess the test's progress and gain lessons for future publications and projects.
