The primary goal of project start is to elicit requirements in order to understand the scope of a prospective solution. Elicitation days are enjoyable, and many business analysts prefer them. These days take place early in the project, possibly even before it begins, and involve meeting with stakeholders to discover what they hope to achieve in a project.

Standard project initiation processes include stakeholder analysis. Stakeholders are any individuals who have a connection to the project, whether they be members of your team, the client, end customers, partners, or others.

It is critical to identify all project stakeholders because complicated initiatives have a profusion of demands, aspirations, and opinions. The more people you include in the early stages of identifying these goals and needs, the easier it will be for the team to agree on a shared goal. A shared vision will help keep the group moving in the same direction. Understanding stakeholders is critical for not only efficiently managing your project, but also ensuring your team meets its project objectives.
