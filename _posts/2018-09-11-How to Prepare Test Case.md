When testing software systems, think of it like visiting a Disneyland Park. Just like how you can miss out on great locations if you don't have a park map, you can miss critical elements in your project without a comprehensive testing plan. That's where test cases come in - they help you keep track of what you need to test, what you've already tested, and what you don't need to test.

As software complexity and the need for quality assurance increases, the importance of effective test cases grows. Test cases are a crucial part of any software testing process, and their quality can make or break the success of your project. In this guide, we will explore best practices for writing effective test cases, including essential elements, design techniques, and common pitfalls to avoid.

# What is a Test Case
A Test Case is a document that outlines a specific set of actions or events designed to test a software product against a particular requirement. The primary purpose of a test case is to ensure that the product meets certain quality standards and is ready to be released.

Test cases provide testers with a set of conditions under which they can validate the accuracy of a specific feature or function of a system. By executing test cases, testers can identify and report any defects or issues in the software product, which can then be addressed by the development team.

Effective test cases are an essential component of any software testing process. They help ensure that the product functions as intended, is reliable, and meets the needs of its users. 



# How to write test case for software:

## Use a clear title

A good test case begins with a clear and compelling title. It is best practice to name the test case after the module that is being tested. If you examine the login page, for example, include "login page" in the title of the test case.

## Include a strong description

Read the description so the examiner knows what they are testing. Other pertinent information, such as the test environment, test data, and prerequisites/assumptions, may be included in this area at times. Test descriptions should be simple to read and understand the test's high-level goals and objectives right away.

## Include estimates and prerequisites

Any applicable assumptions and conditions must be met before the test may be executed. Depending on the test environment and the necessity for a special configuration before running the test, this information may include the page the user should start the test on.

## Keep test steps clear and concise

It is essential to consider the target audience when writing a test case. Remember that, the person who authored the test case may not be the one who runs or executes the test. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the test steps are clear and concise and include all relevant data and instructions necessary to carry out the test.

To achieve this, it's best to use a step-by-step approach to writing test cases. Start by identifying the test objective and then write the test steps in a logical sequence. Make sure to use simple language and avoid technical jargon as much as possible. Write the test case so that anyone can follow it and test it.
- Include anticipated outcomes.
- Expected Results In contrast to their test processes, tell the examiner what outcomes should be produced.
 
The examiner uses this to evaluate whether the test case "passed" or "failed."

## Make it reusable


A good test case provides long-term value to the software testing team by being reusable. To save time, it is best to reuse test cases rather than redo them. 

As a beginner, the best approach to writing test cases is to thoroughly read the software requirements document multiple times to ensure a clear understanding of the needs before starting to write the test case. 

To begin, determine the scenario based on the information provided in the required documents. A test case template is available for practical convenience in preparing test cases.



{: .box-success}
# Do's for Writing Test Case

- [x] It should be simple, precise, and concise.
- [x] User perspective must be taken into consideration.
- [x] Use of the tracebility matrix
- [x] Assign an ID to each of the test cases 
- [x] Try to write independent, reusable, and repeatable test cases. 
     


{: .box-warning}
# Dont's for Writing Test Case

- [x] Do not write unnecessary or redundant test execution steps.
- [x] Do not consider or assume any sort of requirement on your own without consulting the SRS or BRS.
- [x] Do not write reptitive test cases. 
- [x] Do not forget to get the test cases reviewed by the development team.
     

# A Complete Checklist to Check Web Application:

- [x] Is the proper template being used?
- [x] Have the following information been accurately entered? Reference to a requirement, Description of the test script, Name of the author, Created date, Procedure for Installation, Where appropriate, prerequisites
- [x] Have the Test conditions (scenarios) and, if appropriate, the Risk factor been identified?
- [x] Have all explicit and implicit scenarios provided in the requirement been translated into Test conditions?
- [x] Have the linked areas that may be affected by the requirement's implementation been identified and included in the test cases? (Determine the impact areas and cross-check them with the test scenarios.)
- [x] Is equivalence partitioning used? Have all of the domain's classes been accurately identified?
- [x] Is the test data set, if required, properly generated?
- [x] Have you recognized and included the boundary values, special values, and incorrect values in the Test data set?
- [x] Has the Test data been embedded into the test cases?
- [x] Have the required negative scenarios been identified in the test conditions?
- [x] Have the steps been correctly given in appropriate sequence for each test scenario? Steps/Actions should state very clearly the sequence of actions to be carried out on the system by the user. All statements should be definite. Ensure that terms like ‚ÄúIf‚Äù, ‚ÄúIn case‚Äù etc are not used.
- [x] "Have the Expected Results been identified correctly? Expected Results should clearly state how the system should respond to the user actions given in each step/action.
- [x] Ensure that too many things are not included to be verified under one expected output.
- [x] Ensure that separate cases are written for multiple verifications of the application‚Äôs behavior.
- [x] Vague statements like ‚ÄúAppropriate message/value/screen‚Äù etc, should not be part of expected result. Every detail should be clearly spelt out."
- [x] Are all the statements free from grammatical errors?

# Checklist During Test Execution Phase:

- [x] Have the Actual Results been updated for each of the steps? Has the actual result been documented for a failed step and for its subsequent re-runs?
- [x] Have all the steps been executed successfully? Every failed step should have retest details or some disposition if it is not fixed.
- [x] Have the defect details like Defect id, description etc. been given for a failed step?
- [x] Has the reason for the failure been recorded? (For example, invalid input data, new functionality not tested before, existing problem)
- [x] Did a peer recreate the defect before logging it in the Defects database? Have these details been documented?
- [x] Has the defect been retested and if so, have the retest details and the result documented along with the date on which the retest was done?
- [x] Have the Execution details like executed by and executed date, been filled up correctly
- [x] Have the results from different environments (Browsers, for example) been recorded? (If applicable)
- [x] Have the metrics related to the test cases been updated in all applicable metrics documents? (Number of Test cases prepared, executed, Number of test case executions with defects, Total Number of defects etc.)
- [x] Are all the statements free from grammatical errors?
