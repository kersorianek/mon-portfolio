<h3> <p style="text-align: center;"> Living in a simulation? Cybernetic promises and data challenges of digital twins to decarbonise energy systems </p> </h3> 

Decarbonising energy systems by 2050 presents multiple dilemmas between national security, affordability, public support, and health. What if we could model these dilemmas and better anticipate sociotechnical impacts of building a new nuclear station, installation of solar panels on every roofs, or a change in energy tariffs? Digital twins--advanced virtual representations of social and physical processes and objects--promise to achieve that. However, as digital twins are still in the ‘demonstrator’ stage, many questions arise with regards to data accuracy, security; required expertise, and, most importantly, the epistemic foundations of claims made by models, predictions and resulting policy recommendations. This project investigated the sites of knowledge production related to digital twins in the context of energy systems, asking the following questions:
<ul>
  <li>Cybernetic promises: Which futures are afforded through digital twins’ outputs? What do these futures exclude or assume?</li>
  <li>Data challenges: What are potential security and privacy risks associated with digital twins and how to manage them?</li>
</ul>
